 *          which means that even values are rounded down.
 *
 *  @since all VDI versions
 *
 *  @note 
 *  The line width is always in relation to the horizontal pixel size
 *  (if the aspect ratio is not 1:1, the height is corrected so that a
 *  horizontal and a vertical line seem to have the same width, though 
 *  horizontal and vertical pixel size are different - e.g. in ST mid ). 
 *  
 *  Most device drivers ignore the line type and draw solid lines 
 *  if the line is more than one pixel wide.
