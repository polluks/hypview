/** switches from ASCII-mapping to direct mapping, which means that you 
 *  can access all characters of a font (e.g. if the user wants to select a special 
 *  non-ASCII character), but an index like 65 does not stand for 'A' anymore but 
 *  for another character. If you switch to direct mapping, the number of characters 
 *  per font (minADE and maxADE/vqt_fontinfo()) is changed to the number of really 
 *  existing characters.  
 *
 *  @param handle Device handle
 *  @param mode mapping mode
 *         - 0: direct mapping
 *         - 1: ASCII mapping
 *
 *  @since NVDI 3.00
 *
 *  @note
 *  If you want to switch on ASCII-mapping, you should use 1 as \a mode and not 
 *  any other nonzero value, because other mapping might exist in future 
 *  (e.g. Unicode).
 *  
 *  @note
 *  Since NVDI 4 is able to use Unicode for mapping characters, there is an extended 
 *  Binding to select Unicode (see vst_map_mode()).
